  	 <h2>Chicken</h2>
  <p>As a kid you grow up learning new things, you ask questions and you hope that in return you get answers. A question that is often asked is ‘what came first, the chicken or the egg, or how is our food made?’ Many people find answers for things that they don’t know about, but what one doesn’t know might be better for them. What I can tell you is how chickens are raised and the many different ways that they are brought up. What I cant tell you is what came first, the chicken or the egg. I can tell you the difference from a chicken that was brought up in a factory farm from a chicken that was brought up in your back yard. There is a big difference from a factory chicken from a back yard chicken, such as the type of food they are fed, or their living space. Chickens are fed foods that have chemicals in them that can get into the human body. They are also tortured when they are brought up in factories because the chickens are kept in cages where there for four of them will be stuffed into one cage. Chickens are clipped on their feet and beaks so that when they are in a stressful situation they will not peck at the other chickens when they are all in the same cage. Chickens are carried from one factory to another in a truck where over half of the chickens die.</p>
